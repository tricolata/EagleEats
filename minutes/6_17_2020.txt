Today we set up our Jira board with two issues: learn how to use Jira and brush up on our tech stack. As a team we decided it was best for us to
take the time to understand how Jira works so we can use it effectively. Yafet offered to transfer the features from the project proposal
to our Jira board and set them aside in the backlog. We agreed that on monday we will have our first sprint meeting and we will begin 
designing our project and dividing up stories in order to create our website.
